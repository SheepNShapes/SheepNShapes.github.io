            <h1>Welcome to Sheep N Shapes!</h1>
            <p>Stack falling blocks strategically into the pit to build a safe path for the sheep â€“ similar to Tetris. 
                Earn stars and coins based on your building skills. 
                With each level, the challenge grows, and only those who collect enough stars can unlock exciting new worlds.
